## Research Overview 

### Abstract 
> Endosymbiosis, symbiosis in which one symbiont lives inside another,  is woven throughout the history of life and the story of lifeâ€™s evolution.
From the mitochondria residing in almost every eukaryotic cell to gut microbiome found in every human, endosymbiosis is a cornerstone to the biological processes that sustain life on Earth.
While endosymbiosis is ubiquitous, several questions about its origins remain unsolved, such as <XYZ factor> influence the evolution of obligate endosymbiosis.
Expanding on the evolutionary agent-based system Symbulation, we explored the effect of <XYZ factor> on the de novo evolution of obligate endosymbiosis.
We found that <XYZ conditions> does select for <XYZ thing>. 
Specifically, we discovered <XYZ thing we found in more depth>.

### Experiments 

### Results
