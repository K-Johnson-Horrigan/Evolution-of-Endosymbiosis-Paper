Rerunning the 12.03.21_no_ecto_resource_sweep.
The previous settings had it so that endosymbionts could never be mutualistic because then they would never be able to accrue enough resources to reproduce.
Now symbionts have lower reproductive costs across the board as well as a lower maximum age.
Ectosymbiosis is still turned off and conducting a parameter sweep of the resource amounts that free-living symbionts and hosts receive.
